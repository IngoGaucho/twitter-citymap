# Twitter Citymaps Kiezatlas Anniversary

This plugin simply places all publicly geo-coded results to a user-defined Twitter Search API Request on a mobile-compatible citymap with geographic-bitmaps/tiles by Mapbox based on OpenStreetMap.

This plugin assembles cool tools, namely Leaflet and DeepaMehta 4, to be used by kiezatlas@sozkult.de. It is a birthday present for the tenth anniversary of the Kiezatlas-Project which is mapping neighbourhoods with bitmaps since 2003.
